# Hi there! Welcome to my repo

## Maybe you're wondering who I am... right?
I'm a Computer technician with over 15 years by working as technical support. I'm a technology enthusiast (a little obvious, isn't it?), deeply passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest news in the field.
I enjoy researching advancements in disciplines such as 3D design and printing, augmented reality, mobile development, and artificial intelligence.

This dedication to staying informed and exploring new technologies has helped me develop a keen eye for innovation and a commitment to excellence in my work.

## I'm worthy?
Well... I have vast knowledge in several technologies:
Not long ago I've start on development arriving from design. As freelancer, the web was my playground so, as many do, I start playing arround with __HTML__ and __CSS__.
The natural evolution for this was basic knowledge of __Javascript__ to create the interactions for the user interface and, suddenly, I land on __PHP__ by Working on Wordpress. 
I discover the real meaning of "web development" and It delivers me to dive into this language to implement fresh new custom Wordpress Themes. This also unveil the power of __databases__ by interact with __mySQL__ queries througt __phpMyAdmin__

>After a few years, I start to explore new horizons so, in despite to valorate all the journey I've achieve, there was the need to specialize into a branch and, by my prior experience, I decide to focus on by learning about new techniques and methodologies and working to create quality web apps.

In order to ahieve this goal, the last two years, I get propper formation on __Javascript__, learning about it's ecosystem and generating some projects on __Nodejs__ over the __ExpressJS Framework__, getting knowledge about __PostgreSQL__ and the __Sequelize ORM__. 
For the frontend I swim into __React__, implementing some cool stuff by using __Redux__ and styling using __Tailwind__.

I also get on the wave by jump into __Typescript__ and using it to create some projects on new frameworks like __NextJS__ and __Astro__ for the frontend and __NestJS__ for the backend.

This toolbox is in continuous growth and update... it's almost like a living organism: it grows and strengthens the more it is used.
For that reason, and due in my desire to expand and deepen my knowledge, at this moment I'm diving into __JAVA__ and learning how to implement __Microservices__ and __Cloud Services__.
